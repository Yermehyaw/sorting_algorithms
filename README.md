C - SORTING ALGORITHMS AND BIG O NOTATION

Exploring several basic sorting algorits and their various space/time complexity
i.e at best case, average case and worst case. We are especially concerned
with the worst case(upper bound) of our sorting algorithms i.e Big O.

We wil be sorting several data sets in stored in arrays, linked list, and even
hash tables whilst evaluating their different time complexity as the algorithm
used changes.


The following will:

0: Bubble sort: sort an array in ascending order using the bubble sort
algorithm.

1: Insertion sort: sort a linked list data in ascending order using insertion
sort algorithm.

2: Selection sort: sort an array in ascending order also but with selection
algo.

3: Quick sort: sort array with quick sort algo.

4: Shell sort: sort an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell
sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence.

5: Cocktail shaker sort:  sort a doubly linked list of integers in ascending
order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm.

6: Counting sort: sort an array of integers in ascending order using the
Counting sort algorithm.

7: Merge sort: sort an array with merge sort algo.

8: Heap sort: sort an array with heap sort algo.

9: Radix sort: sort an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix
sort algorithm.

10: Bitonic sort: sort an array of integers in ascending order using the
Bitonic sort algorithm.

11: Quick sort: sort an array with quick sory algo.

12: Dealer: sort a deck of cards.
